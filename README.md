# shinyFBS

The shinyFBS application is aimed at FBS handlers who do not have sufficient R experience but nevertheless want to both understand the new methodological framework as well as compile FBS. Within the framework of the new FBS methodology it should allow users to

- review all data and factors which are used in the process
- manually reproduce SUAs and FBS as they are compiled at HQ
- Visualize data
- download and upload data as required

The app is intended to be released as a wrapped desktop application as well as an online hosted site. Also, it is designed to handle any number of countries, however, a single country version should also be provided.
